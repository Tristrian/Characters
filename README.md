> Characters brings the freedom and power back to Minecraft roleplay with a multitude of features.

Characters began as a simple idea: to bring character cards to Minecraft. This is a common feature of many RP servers within Minecraft; however, the plugins that handle this are few and far between. Thus, Characters began.

Characters has since become a project meant to evolve and learn from the needs of its users which are a key part of its development.
